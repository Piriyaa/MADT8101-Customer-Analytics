# Customer Lifetime Value & Customer Scoring
* Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a measure of the total income a business can expect to bring in from a typical customer for as long as that person or account remains a client.
When measuring CLV, itâ€™s best to look at the total average revenue generated by a customer and the total average profit. Each provides important insights into how customers interact with your business and if your overall marketing plan is working as expected.


### Case study Shoppee
* One of the best approaches for customer engagement is building loyalty programs. Loyalty programs are known to have a positive effect on improving CLV as they increase and enrich the interaction between a brand and its customers, boosting spending amounts and inducing repeat purchases.
